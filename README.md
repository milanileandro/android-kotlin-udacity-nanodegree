# Android Kotlin Developer - Udacity Nanodegree
This repository contains the projects developed during Udacity's Nanodegree - Android Kotlin Developer.

# Organization

All projects are developed in a separate branch from the empty branch, thus maintaining the history of commits for each project separately. When a project are completed your branch is sent via pull request to the all-projects branch, the project branch is kept in the repository.

Every project has its README.md file always in the project's root directory.
